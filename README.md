# wechat-rainbow-pull-refresh

This is a function mimicing the wechat-moment-pull-refresh with pure HTML5 and javascript.

lapdesk and mobile device is all supported (tested in window and android(ios))

Based on the ionic-event.js which provide even more powful gestures than hammer.js from my point of view when it comes to mobile devices.

Thanks..
